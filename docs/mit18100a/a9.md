Chapters and exercises given with a numbering are from *Basic Analysis: Introduction to
Real Analysis (Vol I)* by J. Lebl.

### Exercise 3.3.11

Find an example of a continuous bounded function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that does not achieve an absolute minimum nor an absolute maximum on \(\mathbb{R}\).

> Let  
> 
> \[f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\]
>
> Then \(f(x)\in (0, 1)\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\). \(f\) is continuous on \(\mathbb{R}\), \(f\) is bounded, since \(0 < f(x) < 1\),  but \(f\) does not attain a global minimum or maximum because the values 0 and 1 are never reached.

### Exercise 3.4.3

Show that \(f : (c,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) for some \(c > 0\) defined by \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) is Lipschitz continuous.

> For \(x, y > c > 0\),
> \[\left|\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{y}\right| = \frac{|x-y|}{|xy|}\le \frac{1}{c^2} |x-y|\]
>
> Therefore \(f\) is Lipschitz continuous on \((c,\infty)\) with Lipschitz constant \(K = \frac{1}{c^2}\).


### Exercise 3.4.8

Show that \(f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) defined by \(f(x) = \sin(1/x)\) is not uniformly continuous.

> Suppose \(f(x) = \sin(1/x)\) is uniformly continuous. Then for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that for all \(x, y \in (0,\infty)\) with \(|x-y| < \delta\), we have  \(|\sin(1/x) - \sin(1/y)| < \varepsilon.\)
> 
> Consider sequences \(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty},\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) with \(x_n = \frac{1}{2n\pi + \pi/2}\), \(\quad y_n = \frac{1}{2n\pi - \pi/2}\). 
> 
> Let \(\varepsilon = 1\), choose \(M = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi\delta} + \frac{\pi^2}{4}}\). For \(n > M\), we have  
> \[
|x_n - y_n| = \left|\frac{-\pi}{(2n\pi + \pi/2)(2n\pi - \pi/2)}\right|=\frac{1}{\pi (4n^2-\pi^2/4)} < \delta.
\]
>
> However,  
> \[|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = |\sin(2n\pi + \pi/2) - \sin(2n\pi - \pi/2)| = 2 > 1 = \varepsilon.\]
>
> This contradicts the assumption of uniform continuity. Therefore, \(f(x) = \sin(1/x)\) is not uniformly continuous on \((0,\infty)\).

### Problem 4

Let \(S \subset \mathbb{R}\). We say that \(f : S \to \mathbb{R}\) is Lipschitz continuous on \(S\) if there exists \(L \ge 0\) such that for all \(x, y \in S\),
\[
|f(x) - f(y)| \le L |x - y|.
\]

Prove that if \(f : S \to \mathbb{R}\) is Lipschitz continuous on \(S\), then \(f\) is uniformly continuous on \(S\).

> We want to show that for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that for all \(x, y \in S\),  if \(|x-y| < \delta\), then \(|f(x)-f(y)| < \varepsilon\).  
>
> Since \(f\) is Lipschitz continuous,  \(|f(x)-f(y)| \le L|x-y|\).
>
> Choose \(\delta = \varepsilon/L\). Then if \(|x-y| < \delta\),  
> \[
> |f(x)-f(y)| \le L|x-y| < L \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{L} = \varepsilon.
> \]
>
> Thus \(f\) is uniformly continuous on \(S\).

### Problem 5

(a) Prove that \(f(x) = \cos x\) is Lipschitz continuous on \(\mathbb{R}\).

> For all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\),
> \[|\cos x - \cos y| = 2\left|\sin\!\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)\sin\!\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)\right| \le 2\left|\sin\!\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)\right| \le 2 \cdot \frac{|x-y|}{2} = |x-y|\]
> 
> Thus \(f(x) = \cos x\) is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant \(L = 1\).

(b) Prove that \(f(x) = x^{1/3}\) is uniformly continuous on \([0,1]\) and is not Lipschitz continuous on \([0,1]\).

> On the closed, bounded interval \([0,1]\), the function \(f(x) = x^{1/3}\) is continuous, hence by the Heineâ€“Cantor theorem it is uniformly continuous.  
>
> To check Lipschitz continuity, consider \(y=0\) and \(x \to 0^+\):
> \[\frac{|f(x) - f(0)|}{|x - 0|} = \frac{x^{1/3}}{x} = \frac{1}{x^{2/3}} \to \infty\]
> 
> Thus there is no finite \(L\) such that \(|f(x)-f(y)| \le L|x-y|\) for all \(x,y\in[0,1]\). Therefore \(f\) is not Lipschitz continuous on \([0,1]\).


### Problem 6

Let \(R \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(f : [R,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}\). We say that \(f(x)\) converges to \(L\) as \(x \to \infty\) if for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists \(M \ge R\) such that for all \(x \ge M\) we have \(|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon\). We write  
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L.
\]

(a) Prove that  
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 1} = 1.
\]

> For \(\varepsilon > 0\), choose \(M = \sqrt{1/\varepsilon}\). For all \(x > M\),
> \[\left|\frac{x^2}{x^2+1} - 1\right| = \frac{1}{x^2+1} < \frac{1}{M^2} \le \varepsilon\]
> 
> Thus \(\frac{x^2}{x^2+1} \to 1\) as \(x \to \infty\).

(b) Prove that  
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \sin x
\]

does not exist.

> Suppose the limit exists. Take the sequence \(x_n = 2n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}\). Then \(\sin x_n = 1\). Take another sequence \(y_n = 2n\pi + \frac{3\pi}{2}\). Then \(\sin y_n = -1\).  
> 
> Both \(x_n\) and \(y_n\) tend to \(\infty\), but \(\sin x_n \to 1\) and \(\sin y_n \to -1\).  Hence the limit \(\lim_{x \to \infty} \sin x\) does not exist.
