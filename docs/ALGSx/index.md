Sadly, only [Algorithmic Design and Techniques](./ALGS200x.md), [Data Structures Fundamentals](./ALGS201x.md) and [Graph Algorithms]() are highly relevant to general quant interviews. Other topics lie in a niche field of biotech. So completing all courses and receive a micromaster certificate is not rational at all.

The good thing is that my early training of DSA will be finished before November by big chance -- enough systematic training by that time. At the end of the day, I still need to do tons of leetcode, 5 problems per day would be a lovely amount, but that's another story.
