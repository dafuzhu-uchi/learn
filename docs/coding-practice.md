[Quantlib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib) is a great resource, however it's written in C++. Definitely won't work on it before capturing the basics of C++. References for future use: [Implementing quantlib](/pdf/implementingquantlib.pdf), [Quantlib-python Cookbook](/pdf/quantlibpythoncookbook.pdf).

Updated (Oct 25): Now I decided to break into quant dev, so I adjusted my course plan. I gave up the concentration on "Rates and Credits", changing into "Financial Computing". So now my concentrations are "Options and Derivatives" and "Financial Computing". Winter 2025 would be very tough, but once I make it and if I'm still alive, I would be unstoppable.
